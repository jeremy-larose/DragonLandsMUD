Here's how to create responsible portals, the Seikyr way!
1) Creating the portal
  redit exit ? <vnum> <keyword>
2) Setting appropriate flags (secret makes it not show, can_look for free scry)
  redit exflags ? can_enter secret can_look
3) Set the description of the exit (when they type look <keyword>)
  redit exdesc ? <what you want them to see>
 
Remember that when you're doing the exit like this, it takes
precedence over any objects in the room. It'll look at the exit
keyword first, rather than the item in the room if they have
the same keywords, so plan object description/keywords accordingly.
Exits can have more than one keyword, as well.

You can currently do temporary hit points and speed with affect
hit and move, respectively -- the extra points will go away
when the spell ends. Base armor I'll add in, cuz some spells
add armor while some affect base armor.
