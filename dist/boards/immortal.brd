Idea: Set a room to be effected by fog and the percentage. It makes
it hard for the player to see the real that percentage of the time.
They can see exits but few things. Perception might help a bit here.

So a brief explanation on armor class and how it works...
The object worn on Body location provides AC/2
Object worn on Head = AC/6
Object worn on Arms = AC/6
Object worn on Legs = AC/6
 
So in order to have a "complete" suit of armor, you need to have the 
Body, Arms, Legs, and Head. If you're missing the helmet, your total AC
will suffer by 3 for the total, so 15 instead of 18 for Plate. 
 
When setting AC on things, it's out of a 3-digit scale, so AC18 
behind the scenes is actually AC180. This allows for the 
calculation of decimal places in the code, so that we can
divide out the total AC of the player by 10 when doing the math,
as displayed on the score sheet. The total amount displayed
on your score sheet is correct. Just bear in mind when you're
making things that modify AC, that you'll need to multiply
the D&&D amount by 10 to get the correct AC. Shields then,
are AC 20 instead of AC 2, etc.

Things to add to morphset:

1.) Toggle if the form removes clothing or not when the polymorphing
is complete. This is required for forms like animals that can't 
wear pants, etc.
 
2.) Toggle if the form don't not allow you to wear clothing after
polymorphing to avoid hawks with full sets of armor.
 
3.) Offer a description option where a stock temporary description
can be written.
 
4.) Add size to settable options.
 
5.) Add short and long description settable options.
 
6.) Make sure the gender aligns with the player's.
 
7.) Add an "All" for classes allowed to avoid typing in each class
 
8.) Add a # of attacks and attack options (Claws, etc)?

Double check cast allow so that it stops players from casting spells
if they are in the form if the option is set to "no." It currently
doesn't set anything.
 
Check to make sure "affected" works.
 
Make sure the AC set actually adds or removes from the player's
while in the form. Form 1000 should reduce the AC by -10 but
nothing happens.

So yeah.. morphset needs to allow players to actually be able to use
the morph in polymorphing.
 
A possible idea would be to have settable stats, a dice roll option
for hp and move (more in line with the monster manual).
 
Also an option to allow speaking or not.
 
Check to see if keywords work for the look command and replace
the character's info with look with short desc of morph.

Can we have a liquid type blood that can be set for drinkcons? It
would be nice for vials and bottles of blood for vampires.
 
Also can we add a V4 where if it's 0 you it doesn't disappear after
drinking the last drop and a 1 if it gets junked after finishing?
 
Also - there is no "buy" command for some reason... really weird.. lol

Found this:

Obviously don't need mana as part of it and it should just use the
regular hitchar/vict of the spell instead of setting its own. :)

Check to see if the sectors option is working with sset.
 
Also we need a flag for "Caster only" and one so that the spell
or skill cannot be used on themselves (the caster/skill user).
 
Can we also make it so that when it's set to a skill the mana
cost is set to remove move points instead of mana?

Hello!
 
I would like brewing and scribing levels on the final result to be
stable across the game. I think that whatever the material is
is how it will be finalized. So if you use a potion bottle that
can be brewed to create level 10 spells of whatever you brew
that it's the materials that allow it. I was thinking that
the power scales would be level 5, 10, 20, and rarely 30
potion bottles/scrolls/wand/staff materials. A special quest
could be done for level 40 or higher.
 
Like in New Darkhaven I made two potion options for either
level 5 or level 10 potion brewing. The cost of course
increases too.

A heads up on the Overland map, to create an exit to an area use the following:
 1) Move to the room (coordinates) you want to make an exit at
 2) Use setexit create
 3) Use setexit <vnum>, where vnum is the first vnum of your area
 
 This will link your area to the coordinates, you can then move into the # on the map and it will t map and it will transport them to the specified vnum.
 From there, you'll create an exit to the Overland map of your choice
 using the following set of commands:
 
 1) From your room, redit exit <direction> <vnum, of the map (30000 for map1)>
 2) redit excoords <direction> <x> <y> will set the exit to go to the coordinates 3) redit exflags  3) redit exflags <direction> overland will make it so it places the PC on the ma
