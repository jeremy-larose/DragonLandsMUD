I need an optrigger for time like rptrigger. I tried using it for
object 215. I want the deity symbol for the dark moon goddess to
react when it's night time and when dawn approaches. The same
for the sun god, etc.
 
I also need one for fight to check and see if the person is battling
and it does a rand prog.
 
And a prog for when they use a command like "cast," etc.

Can you make a spot on mset/oset that logs a "creator?" So that those
who create glyphs of warding or summon creatures could use one
of the "fake commands" to dismiss it and it checks for the creator?
It would be settable by an mp/rp/op commands like mpowner <$n>.
Or ifowner == $n
 
Then a spell would need a flag like setowner, so the casters name
is set as the owner of the object or created monster.
 
I think it will be helpful for warding spells if the Wizard can
dismiss the ward or move in/out of it when entering.
 
 
Which I will need to check if objects have an entry or greet prog...

Wear locations!
Holy Symbol, Floating Around, Both Hands, Left Hand, Right Hand

Remove:
Light, Missile Weapon
 
I dunno how I feel about having all the wear locations listed.
Especially for classes that will never use shields, dual
wielding, etc.
 
Spell components need to just check to see if the item is on
the players in some location and not only the inventory.

Is there a way to set up a message for objects that when they
run out of time on their timer, it uses the message set up by
the builder?
 
So instead of "Tiny orbs of light mysteriously vanishes" it could
say like, "The tiny orbs of light collide and disappear in a flash!"
 
I think it would look better and offer more customization.

When you get a chance (I know right) - Can you go into the portal

A portal created by Beltane unravels and winks from existence.

We talked about this last night but I felt I should write it down.
Mpreward would grant a player a prize for a quest or something
but using the vnums specified by the builder as the "prize items" of
the area. Sort of like Mpscatter but with items.
 
So like:
Mpreward $n 1500 1510
Mpreward $n 1500 1510
Mpreward $n 1500 1510
 
And the player would receive three items out of that vnum range.
 
Another one to think about is:
 
Mpcoin $n # coin type?
 
So like:
mpcoin $n 20 gold?

Can you make a tool item type and use the V0 for amount of uses
it has left? We need this for various tools.
 
We also need a mpusage for when someone uses a command prog and this
can remove a V0 point off. When it reaches 0 the item gets junked.
 
So something like
opedit fishing add command fish
You caught a fish!
mpusage <vnum> 1
 
So it would remove the one off the v0. Obviously if it would always
use one usage off the v0 to ensure it works.

Just a fun idea for the future - Book writing.
 
So you can purchase a book with blank pages (v0) and you can
write in them so like "book write 1" and it'll start or allow
you to edit page 1. "book read 1" would allow you to read the
first page, etc.
 
A book copy 'leather journal' 'large tome' could allow you to
copy the pages from one to another. And you would need to pay
attention to the language you are currently speaking since it
would write in that language.
 
People could publish their books if they fill out a book and give
it to an admin team member. They would review it, copy it, and
flag it as published. Then we could sell it at a book store or
the player could sell it through their own store system?
 
Just a fun late night idea.

Needed: Instrument object type
Works just like a wand where it can release a spell or it is a

v0 is the uses it has before it is consumed.
 
Needed: Componentbag object tyoe. Only allows components in it.
Works like a container. Spell component bags have high v0 and
can be abused by players who stick things like bows and shit
in them. We need to ensure that only component object types
fit in them.

Well we need the following:
- Swim skill
- Reduce damage done when failing to swim or not swimming by a lot
since it seems to damage too much.
- Reduce the move cost while swimming based on if you are using
the skill or not and how well you swim.
 
I think the no_swim and swim sectors may be messed up. We also need
a sector where it's water but doesn't require swimming unless you
are size small. Perhaps two sectors? One for no swimming needed
for size 2 and then one for size 1? It would make creeks and
such more surprising for smaller types.

Oddly enough if you set a prog on a mob and then create more than
one of them with minvoke.. only the original one will do the prog... 
 
For example check out the city guards in new darkhaven.. the one
day time and night guard will do the progs required. The north
gate guard (wizard) is the only one that creates torches
while her duplicates ignore the prog.

Want to create objects that expire based on number of uses or
based on ticks remaining maybe? 
 
you use a charge, it'll detract from the remaining charges. 
 
Would need an ifcheck to see if there were no charges remaining
Or if there was only one charge remaining to send a custom message
To let the player know that the item is expiring. 
 
Then the builder can decide whether or not the item simply becomes
something else.
 
This exists in some form with the sset component, where it ticks down
the v0 form. So we need a command for a mob to be able to tick down
very similarly to how the casting does for components. Need to be able
to increment it down by one instead of using mposet to change the
value entirely.
