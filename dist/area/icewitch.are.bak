Desc       &WThis white dragon looks very ancient. Her silvery eyes stare out
angrily about the throne room that she seeks to protect. Her scales
ombre from white to silver, which denotes her age. She is quite massive
and takes up much of the throne room.&w

Lore       &WYou see a white dragon circling a tower before it manages to blow
open a hole in the magical protections around the tower. It enters and 
quickly turns the people inside into crystal with its breath. It
seeks out a lone figure in the throne room - an old hag like woman
who begins casting various spells at it. The battle is long and the dragon
wins it in the end. The old woman is devoured by the dragon who then
assumes her shape and begins living as her in the tower...

The forest around here is covered in a lush layer of fallen leaves in
a myriad of autumn colors. Depsite the layer of leaves the trees are
still fairly covered in brightly colored fall leaves. It is almost
as if the trees only produce the type of leaves seen in
autumn and they fall whenever a breeze passes through. The
leaves are crunchy and make noise whenever someone walks
through them. The forest itself looks very ancient against
