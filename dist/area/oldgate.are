Desc       &PThis elven woman is well established as a psychic reader here in
Oldgate. She appears young, but she could be much older than her
looks appear. Her long wavy white blonde hair drapes over her 
shoulders and back in loose, undulating waves. She is dressed in
a long flowing purple robe with the emblem of the goddess Omunae
embroidered on the front. She is seated at a table waiting for
her next client to arrive. Her light brown eyes are full of 
curiosity and wonder as she meets each client.

I continue to fail in my search for the great library, Llekwyn, which
was the jewel of the ancient city of Kaltas. The library was known
to move about as I found in ancient texts, but after the Great Rift
the library was said to be destroyed along with the city. It is rumored
that the great spirit that protected the library simply took the
library away from mortal use and hoards the knowledge.
 
When I pray to the goddess she sends me dreams of an oasis where
a woman speaks of sand and betrayal.

This location is one of many &R-{(OOC)}-&Y locations across the lands.
Each major civilization and some minor villages have such locations 
where you will be able to see/use the global Chat command along with
the OOC version of "Tell," &WOtell&Y. While at these locations you can
enjoy the company of other characters taking a break from RP and talk
OOC. Please remember all rules during conversation and do not use
these locations as a spot to reveal game elements. There is no time
limit here since we know some days you just want to "chat" with your
friends. And when anyone last saw you.. you were "headed off to some
tavern in town."

Desc     The interior of this temple is accented with gold and bronze, which is
used to create delicate looking murals on the walls depicting the god
Tor. The murals depict several religious stories about Tor from him
purging the unlawful to saving those who need him. The temple has an
impressive altar located on the north wall where the faithful come
to kneel and pray to him. There are no pews or places to sit as 
those that follow Tor know that the true work happens outside of the
temple.
