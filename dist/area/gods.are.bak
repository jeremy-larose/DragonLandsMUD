pristine white columns with golden arcane etchings. At the center
of the temple is a massive glowing bonfire set upon a floating
copper colored disc. This is known as the "Godfire," which is
the source of all creation and divine power. The disc stays
perfectly in the center of the space at all times. The view past
this temple is chaotic with volcanoes spewing forth lava and fire.
Large lakes of lava burn their way through rock to create a vein

dryads dance about the grove, providing entertainment. When night falls
a small fire is lit and floating magical candles move about the grove
providing illumination. Various types of fruit trees grow here and
taste perfect when ate. Outside of the perimeter of the grove you
notices miles and miles of starry night sky, which suggest this grove
is not connected to the land of men and lies somewhere beyond it. A small
