of New Darkhaven. The river runs through a stone canal that was built 
before the northern section of the city was incorporated
into one complete city instead of two villages. Two major bridges
were added to help citizens cross the canal on Law and Vertic

fishing. The canal continues to the north and south from here. You hear
the roar of water coming from the south as the canal picks up speed

Flags    nosummon noastral~
Desc     This is a rather large tavern that seems to appear out of no where
suddenly. The floor is invisible, which means you can look down and
see all of the action occurring in the emporium below and you cannot
be seen from above. The tavern features floating furniture from the
tavern's bars to table and chairs. You see a glowing circle to the
north of here and to the east you see a private tent for meetings.
A sign behind the bar proudly proclaims that this tavern and space is
for Wizard's only, which is an older philosophy from the wizaarding
community against those they see as inferior spellcasters such as
Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Mystics who obtain part or all of their
power from another source.

walls can be seen through and you see various people inside what
also acts like a greenhouse. The building is quite modern despite
the other buildings nearby. This temple was created by a talented
group of local engineers using a framework made from silver, which
the clear glass is inserted into. The building has a height of
two stories but it only utilizes one level. The rest is left as
high cathedral like ceilings. A large glass doorway can be
seen to the east from here leading inside the temple. A sign

Name     &zThe Chapel of Shadows&w~
Sector   indoors~
Desc     &zBefore you is a large open space that is used by all the faiths
represented in this congregation to perform religious services
such as rituals, marriages, blessings, and even faith meetings. There
are many rows of pews that lead up to a large center altar space
that features a giant slab of obsidian rock used as the altar. Above
you is the bell of shadows, which is used to announce the coming of
night or day for the faithful. The walls and floor surrounding this
chapel have been painted like a night sky so that the similarly
painted ceiling merges with the walls and floor to create an
optical illusion. Obsidian statues of deities represented by this
congregation line the walls with their eyes focused on the altar.

Desc     &wThis tavern has a dark, gothic aesthetic with the lighting kept very
low and suspensful. Lanterns align the walls that emit a soft lilac
light for the customers. The entire tavern is furnished with luxurious
deep purple velvet chairs made from dark, black-brown colored wood.
The tables are created with the same wood and have been elegantly
shaped. A central bar lines the wall where customers can sit and 
order drinks. A large tapestry is behind the bar, which has been
designed to display a horde of demons flying above a defenseless
village. There is a delicious blend of incense that entices the
senses and never seems to run out. A large fireplace is to the western
wall of the tavern, but it seems to not be used much. A grand
piano is next to a small stage that bards and other performers can
use to entertain customers.

A large makeshift home made from crates, pieces of wood, and boxes

small burning barrel is used for warmth and additional light. A
rug made from rat pelts can be seen in front of the makeshift home

lies deep under the city. You see a medium sized canal that winds along 
this stone path you are on currently. The sewers are lit with very old 
magical globes of light that are slowly fading away with every year until 
they are replaced by the city. The sewers are relatively quiet except for 
the occasion noise made by an animal lurking somewhere. The sounds of 
the sewer canal seem to drown out any other additional noises. You see 
a numerous amount of pipes above that directly empty into the sewer canal.
You see a staircase leading down to a slightly lower level of the sewers
here while the sewer path continues to the east of here.
