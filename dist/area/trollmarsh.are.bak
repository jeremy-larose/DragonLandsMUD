Desc     &GThis area has been cleared of all long grasses from the surrounding
marsh to allow the stone circle to stand prominent. The circle is
comprised of seven large stone slabs that are covered in swamp moss
and vines. The middle of the circle has a floor made of set stones that
create a spiral patterns towards the middle of the circle itself where
a small stone altar is present. This circle seems very ancient and almost
as old as the marsh itself.

great prairie like a plague. There are few areas with thriving trees
as most are decaying due to the marsh. The weeds are high here which
makes it hard to see around the area. The sounds of mud being treaded
can be heard for many miles. The smell of the marsh is very pungent and
reeks of decay and rot.
