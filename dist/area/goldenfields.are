Desc       &GHere stands Tholgar Onuvien, a famed adventurer

heavily muscled despite having given up his adventuring days 
many seasons ago. His dark chestnut hair is slowly turning 
white, having begun at both sides of his head and a streak 
in his widows peak. Dark blue eyes twinkle with pride as 
he watches the fields being tended to in the name of his 
goddess, Amunar.

ExDesc       Chapter One: Fundamentals in Farming

Farming has four standard steps that cannot be missed in order
for a proper, healthy harvest. 

Step One: The fields must be PLOWed in a snake route. Start from
the northwest corner of your field and plow east. Once you have
reached the northeast point head south and begin plowing west. 
Once you have reached the west head south and begin plowing east. 
Repeat this process until the fields are plowed.

Step Two: The fields are now prepared to be PLANTed
with some seeds.

ExDescKey    chapter2~
ExDesc       Chapter 2: The Next Steps

Step Three: The fields need to be WATERed and tended to
as the crop begins to grow. This is the longest of the four
steps and requires patience. Weed the crops to ensure that 
the crops are not destroyed by them.

Step Four: The crop, once fully matured, is ready to be HARVESTed.
It is crucial to turn the crop in for inventory and preservation
because freshly harvested crops will decay without the proper
Chauntean prayers. Please turn in harvested crops to the person
in charge of inventory and harvest operations as soon as possible.

ExDesc       Chapter Three: Protecting the Fields

During the day and night you must check the fields to ensure
that pests are not interfering with the growing process. Remove
these pests to the best of your ability. One method is to SHOO
them away. These pests like to arrive at the night when there is
no one around to protect the fields.

ExDesc       Chapter Five: Harvesting

After your crops have developed, inspect to make sure that
they have fully matured. Once the crops have been matured,
one can begin harvesting in the standard zig zag method, 
starting with the oldest planted crops at the northwest side
of the fields. Each section of the field will yield about a bushel
and this needs to be taken to the person in charge of the harvest.

Crops that are not taken directly to this person will slowly
begin to rot away. This cannot be allowed to happen or the
harvest will be a wasted effort.

and those that seek the abbey harm from entering. The gates have
been built in between two large towers. The walls of the abbey are
tall and appear to be almost two stories tall, useful against foes
that possess great height. Two brackets are built on the side of
each gate for torches during night patrols. A large stone symbol
of a woman's face made out of leaves can be seen hung above
the gates. Her face radiates warmth and compassion to anyone

Desc     The narrow passageway ends here at a roughly shaped corner.
The long silvery strands are thicker here, creating net like 
structures around the ceilings of the passage. A large boulder
is here, with red markings running alongside it. The passageway
is getting progressively more dank and the smell of mold is heavy.

completely covered in the silver strands. The cavern smells musty
and there is a faint scent of decay in the air. Large boulders

Desc     This is one of the many orchards located in the abbey. The
druids here use the orchards to grow both tree based fruits
as well as bush and vine fruits. Vines grow from tree to tree,
heavy with various berries ripe for the picking. All of the trees
and bushes in the orchard have been planted so that they grow
in perfectly spaced out rows. This allows several workers to
harvest from a tree or bush efficiently.
