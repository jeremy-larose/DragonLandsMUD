sayto $n Examples of such are swords, axes, and morningstars.

sayto $n next important thing is that weapons can have additional
sayto $n things that specialize them. A weapon can cause a lot of
sayto $n damage, but be too &Yheavy&w for smaller adventurers to
sayto $n use. A weapon can require some &Yfinesse&w and weapons
sayto $n that are &Ylight&w can be be ideal for dual weapon fighting.
mpsleep 3
sayto $n Some weapons can be &Ythrown&w at your opponent, some
sayto $n can require &Ytwo hands&w to wield it, and my favorite
sayto $n are weapons that can be used with one or two hands.
mpsleep 3
sayto $n Weapons that are used for ranged attacks such as bows

sayto $n Armor is essential for some adventurers to protect themselves.
sayto $n The ringmail armor on this table saved the life of a dear
sayto $n friend many winters ago. All armor can be broken down
sayto $n into three categories.. &Clight&w, &Cmedium&w, and &Cheavy.&w
mpsleep 3
sayto $n This ringmail armor falls into the heavy category. Heavy
sayto $n armor can require great strength in order to wear it and
sayto $n it can effect your weight overall. Heavy armor will also
sayto $n hinder your attempts to hide, which may or may not save
sayto $n your life one day.
mpsleep 3
sayto $n Now medium armor includes hide based armor, a chain shirt,
sayto $n scale mail, or even half plate armor. It works better
sayto $n with one's dexterity to provide reasonable protection.
mpsleep 3
sayto $n And light armor includes padded to studded leather,
sayto $n which is a favorite of those that require stealth.
mpsleep 3
sayto $n Would you like me to continue?

sayto $n Good! Now.. you have already encountered two proficiencies
sayto $n in your previous courses - perception and investigation.
sayto $n However.. there are sixteen more of them for you to learn.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n There are proficiencies that deal with strength.. such as
sayto $n &Yathletics&w. There are also some the deal with dexterity
sayto $n such as &Yacrobatics&w.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n We tend to use a few daily while others we encounter
sayto $n briefly. One who has chosen the Druid's path may use
sayto $n such proficiencies like &Yanimal handling&w, &Ynature&w,
sayto $n and &Ysurvival&w more than &Ystealth&w or &Yperformance.&w
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Depending on your &Ybackground&w you may have already become
sayto $n very proficient with certain types. This means that you will
sayto $n succeed better with those when you use them.

sayto $n Exactly. While a Bard or Cleric may have need of it a Wizard
sayto $n truly is the master of such a proficiency. While your
sayto $n background may conflict with your chosen adventuring path
sayto $n it can also aid you when used.
mpsleep 3
sayto $n Take for example myself.. I am a trained Wizard.. but
sayto $n until I became an apprentice I was what some would call
sayto $n an "outlander." I had to survive in a harsh climate so
sayto $n I'm very survival minded and rather athletic, which
sayto $n can be unexpected for some given my wizardly training.

sayto $n When you type &YWHO&w you will see &R(OOC)&w next to any
sayto $n names of players who are taking a break from the game.
sayto $n And any rooms used for OOC are labeled with &R-{(OOC)}-&w.
sayto $n When a player is in these OOC rooms they are unavailable
sayto $n and any conversations wondering where they went can be
sayto $n answered with something vague such as "He must have wandered
sayto $n off to some tavern for the night," which can be code they
sayto $n have gone OOC for the moment.
mpsleep 3
sayto $n Finally.. there is no length of time for OOC taverns. A
sayto $n player can stay there for as long as possible. The taverns
sayto $n are for fun and a place to unwind with your DLoc pals. All
sayto $n character related roleplay is checked at the door.

sayto $n It is time for us to discuss the different types of people
sayto $n who you will encounter. First is the &GWizard&w who is the
sayto $n master of the arcane arts. The &GCleric&w is the servant of
sayto $n the very deities themselves and represent them in the realm.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n The &GDruid&w is the nature based version of the Cleric
sayto $n and serves the deities of the forest, agriculture, and
sayto $n even the wilds. 
mpsleep 5

sayto $n Now the &GFighter&w is the master of physical combat and its
sayto $n opposite is the stealthy &GRogue&w. The &GBarbarian&w relies
sayto $n on strength and rage to surpass their physical limits in battle.
sayto $n The &GRanger&w is a combination of Druid and Fighter. They
sayto $n are survivalists in the wild and serve the deities of nature.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n &GPaladins&w are a holy fighter and serve the gods along
sayto $n with the clergy. Sometimes we hear of Paladins who revoke
sayto $n their oaths and go down a dark path...
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Moving on the next example is the &GMonk&w, who uses a calm
sayto $n mentality and quick attacks. &GBards&w are a jack of all trades
sayto $n types and like to use different types of spells that can often
sayto $n be seen with Clerics and Wizards.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n And last is someone who never specialized and often learned 
sayto $n everything on their own.. &GAdventurers&w. While not reaching

sayto $n Even now as we begin this lesson the gods and goddesses
sayto $n are watching. I am Fhurn and I am a Cleric of the Goddess
sayto $n &COmunae&w, who rules over the divine portfolios of knowledge,
sayto $n scholars, monks, inner wisdom, psychics, and the element of
sayto $n air. Some deities have many &Cportfolios&w, which are
sayto $n topics, ideas, things, or emotions that a deity has
sayto $n dominion over. These portfolios are managed by the deity
sayto $n and the clerics that serve the deity.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n There are many deities and portfolios.. such as &CAmunar&w
sayto $n who is the &CGoddess of Agriculture&w,&C Growth&w, &CHerbs&w,
sayto $n &CCommunity&w, &CCooking&w, and the &CEarth&w elemental
sayto $n portfolio. Deities will have allies and enemies. An
sayto $n example is &CAkemis&w, whose portfolios of &CDestruction&w,
sayto $n &CStorms&w, &CTempests&w, and the &CFire&w elemental
sayto $n portfolio. Akemis or the "Storm King" goes against
sayto $n everything Amunar represents.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n It is a choice whether or not to follow a deity.
sayto $n However, there are many benefits such as using some
sayto $n of the &Cfavor&w you have earned to retrieve blessings
sayto $n or assistance.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Clerics in order to cast spells must keep their &Cfavor&w
sayto $n with a deity at a positive level or their deity may
sayto $n ignore their prayers.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n There are three &CCongregations&w located here in New
sayto $n Darkhaven where representatives of various deities are
sayto $n located. Their jobs are to tell you about their faith
sayto $n so that you can decide which deity to follow. I suggest

sayto $n and prayer be successful.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n There are three &CCongregations&w located here in the
sayto $n city of New Darkhaven. These temples have representatives
sayto $n from all of the faiths and they will tell you about their
sayto $n deity if you ask. This can help you decide which god or

sayto $n go there and visit all three.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n However... a word of caution... temples outside of this

sayto $n watch yourself when not in this city.

sayto $n Welcome. Let us get started so I can return to my research.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Many many many many manyyyy years ago there was the &YGreat Rift&w
sayto $n which destroyed much of the realms and reshaped it the way we
sayto $n know it today. Gods battle gods, races battled races, and dragons
sayto $n battled dragons. The whole realm had fallen into chaos.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n That is when the realms began to fall away into the
sayto $n other planes and we almost lost everything. A group
sayto $n of adventurers here at what was once the city of Darkhaven
sayto $n devised a plan at the tower owned by &YSoronys&w. These
sayto $n adventurers worked with the gods and good dragons to change
sayto $n the tower into an anchor that would hold the planes together.

sayto $n Now the tower stands as the anchor of the all the planes
sayto $n of existence. This conduit of power keeps us from flying
sayto $n into oblivion! Four dragons and the racial deities gave
sayto $n their lives to empower this structure.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Entrance into this tower is very rare and it is said that
sayto $n those who can enter it can find themselves capable of
sayto $n planar travel! The keys to the tower have been lost for
sayto $n quite some time so it is doubtful we will ever know if
sayto $n this is true or not.
mpsleep 3
sayto $n Now the Great Rift destroyed much of our realms and
sayto $n reshaped other parts of it. The village of Skyfall was
sayto $n originally much bigger and parts of it flew into oblivion
sayto $n during a battle between two gods there. The elven homeland
sayto $n was cut off from the main continent and is now its own
sayto $n island. After some time we have adjusted to these changes.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Who knows what will become of the realms next
sayto $n or what major event will happen. All we know is
sayto $n that right now we have peace.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n That is all I have for you now. Good luck.

sayto $n Greetings. While most students who get to my lessons and beyond
sayto $n may not be dedicated magic users.. it is good to know
sayto $n the basics so that you may help those that wield
sayto $n such energies. 
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Casting a spell requires a great deal of concentration
sayto $n and intent. Some spells require the usage of &Rcomponents&w
sayto $n to release the spell. 
mpsleep 5
sayto $n To cast a spell one must &RCast '&WSpell name&R' <Target name>&w.
sayto $n Once you cast it you cannot take the spell back
sayto $n so you must be careful with casting spells. Some
sayto $n spells are &Roffensive&w, in which they will cause
sayto $n damage to your foes. Other spells are &Rdefensive&w
sayto $n in which it can bolster your allies or yourself.
sayto $n Spells such as Mage Armor or Barkskin are examples
sayto $n of abjuration spells that raise one's defenses.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n You need to know ahead of time before you cast
sayto $n so research into the spells is crucial. Some
sayto $n spells grow with time. All spells except
sayto $n &Rcantrips&w require study and memorization
sayto $n before casting. Cantrips are spells that are easy
sayto $n for magic users to use and they do not require
sayto $n any study to prepare. They can also help you
sayto $n save your powerful spells for when you need them.

sayto $n Now.. let us discuss the different types of magic schools.
sayto $n Knowing these schools can help you in the future. The
sayto $n schools of magic are &REvocation&w, &RAbjuration&w, &RIllusion&w,
sayto $n &RNecromancy&w, &RConjuration&w, &RDivination&w, &REnchantment&w,
sayto $n &wand &RTransmutation&w. There are three other types, but
sayto $n they are derived from a combination of various schools.
sayto &RTheurgy&w, &RInvention&w, and &RWar&w are the examples of such.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Each school is part type of magic such as evocation
sayto $n being involved with spells that have an elemental
sayto $n basis.. spells such as &RFireball&w are a great
sayto $n example of spells from this school of magic.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n An important thing to consider when casting spells is
sayto $n the type of damage it creates. Some foes you may
sayto $n encounter can have &Rimmunities&w, &Rresistances&w, or
sayto $n &Rsusceptibilities to types of spell damage. An
sayto $n example is Beholders have a high level of resistance
sayto $n to &Rpsychic&w based spells due to their own psychic
sayto $n nature. It is important to learn about these and
sayto $n use that knowledge to overcome challenging foes.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n The types of spell damage types are &Rfire&w, &Rcold&w,
sayto $n &Racid&w, &Rbludgeoning&w, &Rforce&w,&R lightning&w,
sayto $n &Rnecrotic&w, &Rpiercing&w, &Rpoison&w, &Rpsychic&w,
sayto $n &Rthunder&w,&R slashing&w, and &Rradiant.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Knowledge is power and those that wield magic
sayto $n must constantly be learning and experimenting to
sayto $n push the craft of magic further.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Good luck out there and may Crisma watch over you.

sayto $n Hello! It's time to learn how magic users prepare their
sayto $n spells. As your previous class instructed you all spells
sayto $n except cantrips need to be prepared through studying
sayto $n and &Rmemorization&w.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n You can see what spells you have memorized and how
sayto $n many spells you have studied by using &RMEMORIZATION&w or
sayto $n &RMEM&w as a short version. You will need your spellbook
sayto $n in order to see this information and to prepare any spells.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n In order to memorize a spell you must know th spell first
sayto $n whether having learned it from a scroll or from a teacher.
sayto $n When you're ready you will memorize it such as &RMEM FIREBALL&w
sayto $n and if you know that spell it will be memorized into
sayto $n your third circle of spells.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n You can only memorize a certain number of spells and
sayto $n if you have additional slots you can use those slots to
sayto $n cast a prepared spell.

sayto $n remove it you can simply &RFORGET&w it. You would
sayto $n do something like &RFORGET FIREBALL&w and that
sayto $n remove the prepared fireball spell. 
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Studying a spell can take time and the more powerful
sayto $n the spell the longer it will take. Also the more
sayto $n spells you prepare the longer it can take.
mpsleep 5

sayto $n Greetings. Let us begin the lesson on brewing, hmm?
mpsleep 3
emote swishes a glass bottle and smiles as it turns purple
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Brewing is an art. It takes great concentration, the
sayto $n ability to cast the spell, and sometimes lots and lots
sayto $n of money. Brewing is not a cheap process so be prepared
sayto $n for that.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n In order to brew you must have the spell prepared
sayto $n and memorized. You must have the correct spell components
sayto $n available as well. And you must have a fire to brew
sayto $n with, the container for the potion, and water in order
sayto $n to create the potion.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n An important factor is that there are different types
sayto $n of potion bottles.. which allow you to brew even more
sayto $n powerful spells. These bottles can get increasingly
sayto $n expensive so beware.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n When you have everything ready and available you
sayto $n simple &RBREW <SPELLNAME>&w. Such as &RBrew
sayto $n &R'Mage Armor'&w will brew you a potion of that
sayto $n spell.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Are you ready for more?

sayto $n Good. Now some final notes is to protect yourself during
sayto $n brewing. There can be a chance of failure that results in
sayto $n an acidic explosion. This can ruin your clothing and such
sayto $n so take proper precautions.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n You will also need a lot of time put aside when brewing
sayto $n since it can take a lot to get the potion correct.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n That is all I have to teach you. The rest will come from
sayto $n you practicing and experimenting. You can come up with
sayto $n unique combinations as you grow in skill and are able
sayto $n to brew more than one spell per bottle.
mpsleep 5

mpsleep 3
sayto $n Greetings! Our lesson is actually fairly short as scribing
sayto $n is similar to its sister, brewing. You must have the
sayto $n spell prepared and memorized, parchment to scribe the
sayto $n spell on, ink, and a quill.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Similar to brewing there are different types of parchment
sayto $n that allow you to craft even more powerful spells on to
sayto $n the paper.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n In order to do it you simply &RSCRIBE <SPELL NAME>&w
sayto such as &RScribe Fireball&w. Speaking of fire you must
sayto $n be careful since a failure can set you on fire... so
sayto $n take care and protect yourself. 
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Now unlike brewing a scroll with a spell scribed on it
sayto $n can be used by fellow Wizards and other magic users to
sayto $n learn spells. Some wizards charge for this and others
sayto $n like to give it at the end of a lesson to their
sayto $n apprentices. If you have a scroll and wish to learn
sayto $n the spell you can &RWRITE SCROLL&w to attempt to learn
sayto $n the spell. You must have a quill, ink, and your spellbook
sayto $n handy in order to do this.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n That is all I have to teach you. I wish you all the best
sayto $n and if you have completed your combat training you may
sayto $n speak with the Headmistress of the College in order
sayto $n to graduate. If you have not finished your combat
sayto $n training you will need to have that done.

sayto $n Well done! Now those dummies are not overly strong
sayto $n it at least shows you the flow of battle, which is
sayto $n like a dance. It can also go very quickly and you
sayto $n must be observant during it. Magic users should
sayto $n be strategic with their spellcasting and those
sayto $n who are fighting based should focus on a quick
sayto $n take down of the opponent.
mpsleep 5

sayto $n inclined should be guarded. Clerics and Druids can
sayto $n handle themselves well.. but if you should lose your
sayto $n source of healing it could provide a problem later.

mpsleep 5

mpsleep 5

sayto $n This completes all of your combat training. Once

ladders and use magic to float up to their bed area. A large crystal
chandelier hangs in the middle of the impossibly large space
and offers soft light during the night time hours.
