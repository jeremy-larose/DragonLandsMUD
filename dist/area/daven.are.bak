sayto $n before releasing them to the wild.. however.. something decided
sayto $n to sneak in at night and eat all but one of them. I need you
sayto $n to find what did it. This will help me keep track of what sort
sayto $n of animals or creatures are in this area. I would prefer if it
sayto $n is an animal that it was not killed. I just need to know what
