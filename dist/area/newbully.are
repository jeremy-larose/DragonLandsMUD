Desc     The inside of the dome is just as impressive as the outside construction.
The dome has torches aligning the walls and the floor has been carefully
cut from local willow trees and joined nicely. They have a brilliant
polish to them and are kept tidy. A long hallway starts here and
heads south. Guards move about keeping an eye on everything.
Two sections of the dome are to the east and west of here.
