Sayto $n Well enough about my love for these crystals. They have
Sayto $n powerful usage as the support for more complex recipes

mpsleep 2

Sayto $n Well done! It is not easy to find these crystals and it can
Sayto $n be rather dangerous. Those crystals in your possession
Sayto $n represent polarities of good and evil. While the crystals

Sayto $n from those energies. These crystals lend their energies to

sayto $n Wonderful! Alchemy is a powerful skill that allows you to

sayto $n Your first task is to find a fire elemental shard. Shards
sayto $n exist in places of great elemental power. Fire shards
sayto $n for example live in very hot places. Shard clusters are

sayto $n detect invisible or true seeing cast upon you.

Sayto $n Well done my child! Alchemy is a fine art, but there are also
Sayto $n dangers! One must be in full control, be at their peak levels
Sayto $n of knowledge in arcana, and be very flexible with results.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n Most of the knowledge you will need can be found in the book
Sayto $n located in your alchemy kit. It can get lost in there so you may
Sayto $n need to look for it. The book contains recipes and how to melt
Sayto $n the crystals.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n Now.. the first step is to melt each crystal and catch the essence
Sayto $n in an empty glass test tube. Many recipes require a vehicle for
Sayto $n for the recipe to work.. such as a specific stone such as an
Sayto $n earthstone. The driver for most alchemy is fire and you will need
Sayto $n have a fire prepared prior to working. You will also place your kit
Sayto $n on the ground so you can grab at tools easily.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n If you should fail at the melting stage you more than likely will
Sayto $n just burn yourself. When you get to recipes you may cause an
Sayto $n explosion that hurts everyone around you. You may want to find
Sayto $n a safe place to work alone at that stage. Explosions tend to destroy
Sayto $n all of ones work so try to ensure your arcanic skill is at its highest
Sayto $n level of performance before attempting the recipe stage.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n The recipes for three basic items can be found in the book in
Sayto $n your kit. Please be careful, but do not lose your experimental
Sayto $n spirit either! Who knows what you will create with alchemy!
Sayto $n Good luck and happy mixing!

do the following:
 
&Y1.)&w Find the shard and mine it with an elemental pick.
&Y2.)&w Light a fire.

risk accidents during the process. One should bolster their

ExDesc       &OThe following are common recipes done using alchemy:&w

&OBRIGHTSTONES&w
&YNeeded:&w 1 negative tube, 1 positive tube, 1 earthstone
&YSteps Required:&w
&Y1.)&w Prepare the standard alchemical practice, but instead carry
    &wthe earthstone and place the tubes next to the fire.
&Y2.)&w Once ready simply &YBRIGHTSTONECREATE&w to create one.
 
&OMAGESTONES&w
&YNeeded:&w 1 air tube, 1 water tube, 1 positive tube, 1 negative
        &wtube, 1 blue spinel gem&w
&YSteps Required:&w
&Y1.)&w Prepare the standard alchemical practice, but instead carry
&w    the blue spinel and place the tubes next to the fire.
&Y2.)&w Once ready simply &YMAGESTONECREATE&w to create one.
 
&OSTARSTONES&w
&YNeeded:&w 1 earth tube, 1 air tube, 1 fire tube, 1 water tube, 1
        &wpositive tube, 1 negative tube, and 1 moonstone gem
&YSteps Required:&w
&Y1.) &wPrepare the standard alchemical practice. You will need
    &wto mix the water and fire tubes (MIXWATERFIRE). This
    &wwill stabilize the elements. Next you will need to mix the
    &wair and earth tubes (MIXAIREARTH) to also stabilize.
&Y2.) &wOnce you have the two tubes you will need to carefully
    &wmix them together (MIXELEMENTALTUBE).
&Y3.) &wOnce ready you will need to be carrying both the moonstone
    &wand final mixture. You will simply &YSTARSTONECREATE&w to create one.

&OWarning! This last step requires a high degree of knowledge
and proficiency with the arcana skill. Failure can ruin prepared
components and cause an accident.
