Sayto $n that is randomly chosen by fate.
Mpsleep 2

Comlist   If isaffected($n) == spirit
Sayto $n Often a mortal will make a pact with some sort of
Sayto $n patron, which can help that mortal return to the
Sayto $n living. Often these patrons will require you to do
Sayto $n something in the mortal realm that will complete
Sayto $n the pact.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n Patrons can be found hiding in this village despite
Sayto $n our efforts to drive them out. Their offers can be
Sayto $n dangerous or even go against your moral code so
Sayto $n if you choose this route you are warned.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n If you did not complete the pact and return here again
Sayto $n you will find that patron to be very upset with you. It
Sayto $n is possible that they will refuse to help you until the
Sayto $n original pact is complete. This often results in a few
Sayto $n unprepared souls becoming permanent residents here.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n Only agree to a pact if you will complete it right
sayto $n away upon being returned to the material plane.

Comlist   If isaffected($n) == spirit
Sayto $n If you were traveling with a skilled healer then perhaps
Sayto $n they are currently working to use a spell such as RAISE
Sayto $n DEAD or RESURRECTION to bring you back to life. They
Sayto $n could also take you to a temple and have the Cleric there
Sayto $n bring you back. These are the more Qylain accepted
Sayto $n methods of being brought back to life
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n The other more.. nefarious way.. Is to use a spell like
Sayto $n CLONE, which allows a magic user to awaken in a new
Sayto $n body somewhere else upon death. There are a few others
Sayto $n that ward off death or conditions that stop it from happening.
Sayto $n Many of the Qylain faith seek to stop such practices as it
Sayto $n interferes with the natural order of things.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n If you know someone is going to bring you back you are
Sayto $n welcome to visit around the village until then. You need to
Sayto $n stay out of the &ROOC&W tavern if you are waiting or else
Sayto $n their spell will fail upon casting.
Else
Sayto $n For more information you can seek out the help files on
Sayto $n the spells discussed such as RAISE DEAD.

Arglist   p orb hunting~
Comlist   If isaffected($n) == spirit
Sayto $n Those that seek a way back to the living can be
sayto $n employed by our local ranger. Soul orbs are residual
Sayto $n necrotic energy that comes from the act of dying on the
Sayto $n material plane. If left where it is it can infect the area 
Sayto $n surrounding it causing decay. We recycle this energy to 
Sayto $n maintain this plane.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n The amount of orbs needed to be collected by someone
Sayto $n is dependent on how advanced of an adventurer they are.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n You will find that the more advanced the longer this hunting
Sayto $n can take while young adventurers just starting out can be
Sayto $n done much quicker.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n Seek out Martivus at his home here in the village if you
Sayto $n wish to hunt orbs for the village. He is our hunter and will
Sayto $n have much more to say on this task.

Comlist   If isaffected($n) == spirit
Whistle
Sayto $n Now that is an advanced method and requires a skilled
Sayto $n adventurer. This method requires a spirit such as yourself
Sayto $n to find a way off of Icynth and back to the material plane.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n Once there you would need to navigate the realms until
Sayto $n you find your body where you would re-enter it.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n However, you do not have a large window of opportunity
Sayto $n here. Upon death the spiritual cord between you and your
Sayto $n corpse begins to diminish until it fades away permanently. 
Sayto $n If you do not make it to your body in time you will become 
Sayto $n stuck on that plane as what the warmbloods call a ghost.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n You can still be brought back by warmblood spells while
Sayto $n stuck on the material plane, but you must be in the same
Sayto $n area in order for it to work. While in Icynth you can be
Sayto $n anywhere and their spells will bring you to them, which is
Sayto $n the benefit of being here versus the material plane as a
Sayto $n ghost.
Mpsleep 2
Sayto $n Also while you are on the material plane as a ghost, you
Sayto $n will need to avoid soul hunters. These trained spirits are on
Sayto $n the material plane with the task of returning wayward souls
Sayto $n back here to Icynth. If you are caught you will be sent back
Sayto $n and imprisoned for some time. While imprisoned you cannot
Sayto $n return to the living until the sentence is finished. Being a 
Sayto $n ghost is frowned upon by Qylaith and those that worship her.

sayto $n peace while others like to return to the material plane of
sayto $n of the "Warmbloods."
mpsleep 2
sayto $n As a spirit you can fly, walk through doors that are
sayto $n not enchanted to block such, and travel great distances.
sayto $n Mortals will need to cast the spell SPEAK WITH DEAD in
sayto $n order to see you if you go to the mortal plane. They will
sayto $n see you just fine if they visit here.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n That spell also allows them to talk to you and also hear what
sayto $n you say back. Some spirits have been known to possess
sayto $n warmbloods or create hauntings.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n As a spirit you will not have hunger or require something
sayto $n to drink... although we have some great taverns here in the
sayto $n village. You will also have no need to sleep as well.

ExDesc       &WHello!

&wThis location is one of many &R-{(OOC)}-&w locations across the lands.
Each major civilization and some minor villages have such locations
where you will be able to see/use the global &RChat&w command along with
the OOC channel &ROsay&w. While at these locations you can enjoy 
the company of other characters taking a break from RP and 
talk OOC. 

Please remember all rules during conversation and do not use
these locations as a spot to reveal game elements. There is no time
limit here since we know some days you just want to "chat" with your
friends. Please review &RHELP OOCTAVERNS&w for more information 
on the rules.

Please note that while in an OOC tavern you &Rcannot&w be raised or 
resurrected. If you are awaiting such you will need to go 
somewhere else. Do not use this location to pander for raise 
dead/resurrection help using the Chat command. Death is considered 
a role playing scenario.

And when anyone last saw you.. you were "headed off to some
tavern or inn in town."
 
Thanks!

was a stern god who did not enjoy failure. He was known for his white hair
and beard as well as an eye patch to hide the missing eye he lost during
a battle with the orcish god Urkmash. His wife Genda was known for
soothing his ego and anger by merely touching him.
 
Thudrin sacrificed himself during the Great Rift to help stabilize
the realm and save his dwarven children from annihilation. He gave
part of his essence to the dwarven engineer, Dhordolim, whom he charged

ExDesc       &zThe drow spider goddess Lolth was known for driving her followers
to fight amongst themselves and with the surface dwellers of Aerix. She
was a vengeful goddess with a jealous streak and loved to sacrifice
her own followers.
 
&zDuring the Great Rift the goddess watched from her Underdark
prison as the other gods and legendary creatures battled. Using
their weakeness she broke the divine magics that kept her and
her drow from reaching the surface. She led them into battle
against the human kingdoms until she was driven back with the
help of the human patron god, Soarin, and the elven pantheon
of gods. Unknown to Lolth was that the goddess Khaersyx had
snuck into the Underdark and awaited for the weakened Spider
Queen to be sent back. Khaersyx murdered Lolth and took over
her divine portfolios and escaped the Underdark before it
was resealed.

ExDescKey    urkmash~
ExDesc       &RThe orc god Urkmash was known for his bloodthirst and attempts to
lead his followers against the elven kingdom of Elheleska. Urkmash
would appear to his followers as a red skinned orc with bright
green eyes. He also helped create Half-Orcs by willing his followers
to take capture and take human mates. It is said that these
half-orcs can still hear him or something whispering to them.
 
Urkmash was an ancient deity and was destroyed during the great
100 year war with the elven gods. During these wars Urkmash
was successful in taking out one of Thudrin the dwarven god's eyes
as he tried to protect the elven god Lornas. It is said that
Thudrin never forgave Lornas for this maiming and may be the
root of dislike between elves and dwarves. By their combined
might the elven and dwarven gods destroyed Urkmash. However, he
willed his divine portfolios and essence to Theuros and lives
on in the god of war.

&CLornas, like all of the elven gods, sacrificed himself to save
the realms during the Great Rift. He lent his energies to stabilize

dark acts to please their lord. Vorpix was a powerful wizard and was
known as the "Laughing Skull," which was attributed to the fact he was
a lich before ascending to demigod status. He did so with the help of his
goddess Khaersyx. The goddess viewed him as a "son" and sought to raise
him to power during the Great Rift. 
 
During the Great Rift Vorpix helped Khaersyx kill the goddess Lloth, which
he siphoned some of her divine essence to rise to godhood. At some point
before the Great Rift was over he was stopped and destroyed by Honeth
before he could take more divine energy. This act branded Honeth the number
one enemy of Khaersyx forever.
 
It is said that a powerful cult has risen to help raise the Laughing Skull
back to life and to godhood again...
