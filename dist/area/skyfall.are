sayto $n Skyfall Village began as three separate neighboring villages
sayto $n that were friendly with one another. During the Great Wars
sayto $n the Black Horde marched their troops towards Darkhaven and
sayto $n first encountered the villages located in this area.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n When one village fell the people would rush to the next one
sayto $n for safety. When the second village fell to the soldiers
sayto $n what was left of the two villages retreated to the final
sayto $n third village. That village still stands here today and 
sayto $n it was led by my ancestor, Raloquinal Skyfall.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Ralo as he was often called gathered up his best troops and
sayto $n those brave enough to help him. It is said that he rode upon
sayto $n a white horse and was armed with a powerful magical blade
sayto $n given to him by Honeth herself. He managed to keep the Black
sayto $n Horde stalled until reinforcements from Darkhaven arrived to
sayto $n help and drive them away.

sayto $n The remaining villagers decided to stay here and the new
sayto $n village was named after my ancestor. Unfortunately Ralo
sayto $n died when the Great Rift happened. This village was not
sayto $n located near any sea originally and when Soronys succeeded
sayto $n in patching our world back the sea rushed in and swallowed
sayto $n much of the town while pieces of it fell into the rift.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n It is unknown if Ralo was on a part of the village that
sayto $n fell into the rift or drowned when the sea came crashing
sayto $n into the village. His brother, Rounim, took over and the
sayto $n village repaired itself.
mpsleep 5
sayto $n Today we serve as the location of the Sky Dragon Express,
sayto $n which allows people to travel over the rifts safely. We also
sayto $n are a source of fish and sea goods for Darkhaven island.
