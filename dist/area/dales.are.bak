Desc     This dirt path cuts through a forest where a small village has been
established. Much of the original forest has been left in its original
condition while the homes and other buildings have been worked around
the natural setting in perfect harmony. Houses are either built into
small forested hillsides or near them. A few homes are built up into
large trees with ladders helping people climb down or up. The overall
village is very rustic and well attuned to the forest it resides in.
A small store selling tack and supplies for horses can be seen to
the north from this dirt path while the path continues to the south

Desc     This is a forest path that follows along the edge of a huge wooden
lodge. The forest around the path is very dense and hard to see through.
The path is partially obscurred by the foliage around it and those who
are perceptive will be able to find it and navigate this pathway.

Desc     &GThe forest path ends here at the banks of a large pond that borders
against a dense forest. The pond has almost crystal clear waters where one
can see all the way to the bottom. The pond itself seems very deep
towards the middle as the gradient of the water turns black at
the bottom. A small path leads out along the pond to the south
while a path leading north into the forest is here.

Desc     This is a public dock used by the local villagers to fish off from or
to set out their boats prior to sailing about. The water of the pond
looks almost clear and refreshing as it sparkles in the light during
the sun's reign. The dock seems to be new and recently crafted from
wood sourced locally.
