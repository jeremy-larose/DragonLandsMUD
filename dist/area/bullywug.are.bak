The trees range from very old willows to decaying pine, a sign of

north up a hill. The original path leads both east and west.

Desc     The field has higher level of moisture, which causes the rolling fog
to settle high above the tall grasses. This provides better visibility
of the field despite the tall grass and plants. The water stands
above the ground by a couple of inches. In the distance you can here
the rustle of grass and splashes of water. Towards the south the
water level is rising dangerously.
