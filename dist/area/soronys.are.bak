ExDesc       Dear Visitor,
 
This tower upon my dying breath and last act to save the realm from
splintering off has become an anchor. In order to keep our material
realm from falling away into other realms my magics and assistance
from the deities themselves used this tower to keep our realm whole
as best we could. The act changed this tower and made it possible 
for people to use it to travel to parts of the realm that have
become hard to reach since the splintering occurred.
 
Be wary! The tower has many dangers that lurk in it.. especially
to those that gain access to the upper reaches. There are many
keys that reach various parts of the tower and their whereabouts
are unknown since the tower was changed. I fear my own apprentice
has run off with one himself in an act of pure greed.
 
If you choose to use the tower be careful and may Crisma watch
over you.
 
- Soronys Stormheart, Archmage of Darkhaven

Desc     The hallway ends here at a wall where there is one large door. The door
itself is comprised of only glass, which swirls and changes colors
rapidly. The door itself seems to glow unnaturally and there is a door
knob located in the center of the door. The knob itself seems to change
shape and is never the same shape twice. It seems to be made from a silvery
material and glistens in the light. Every so often when the door is 
changing colors a staircase leading up can be seen on the other side
of the door.

the marble staircase here. The cavern was carved deep under ground
and cleared to resemble a room. Towards the southern end of the cavern
is a large black door. Spiderwebs have formed along the door frame in
intricate patterns that are eerily beautiful. At the center of the door
is a stained glass window depicting an underground world that has a
bright greenish hue. The window is framed with a black colored metal
frame of a spider. A spot for a key to be inserted is located next to
a spider shaped door knob.

small. However, upon closer examination one sees the various constructs
of small size moving about the kitchen under the direction of the
construct that acts as the main chef. The kitchen despite its size is
quite capable of creating a large amount of food in a short amount
of time. A large cook stove is heated with logs of wood and is always
being used to prepare meals.
