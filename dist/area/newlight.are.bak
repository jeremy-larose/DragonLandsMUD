Desc       &WThis ghost appears to be a young human male about the age of
twenty. He is dressed in tattered robes that appear to have once
been a deep blue shade. His eyes are now dark black portals and his
hair is a wild shade of white that whips about with some unseen
wind. He looks to be in some sort of distress.
~
Lore       &WYou see a young man dressed in robes falling from a ship that is
caught in a whirlwind of magical energies. You hear the creaking of
the boat as it snaps under the impact of a magical wave striking its
side. The wizard falls into water and swim up to watch in horror
as reality itself seems to twist in on itself. The water begins to
boil and you hear the young man screaming before all goes black...

rises like a wave of sandy earth. You can barely see a forest to the south

on top of it to achieve a panoramic view of the lands. To the north
is the sea with a sandy beach bordering it. A large lighthouse is
stationed towards the northeast, but it appears run down. A massive
forest can be seen to the south and a city appears to grow in
the middle of it. The path along this dune continues to the south as
it crawls downwards or to the west.

The maintenance on the lighthouse has been lacking for many years and it
is surprising that the lighthouse still stands to this day. Holes
in the walls allow people to peek inside and few dare to enter it
or even climb to the top. The door to the lighthouse is made from
rotting wood and appears to have once been a bright cherry red in

Desc     This is the third floor of an abandoned lighthouse. The floors here
are quite destroyed looking and weak in several spots. This appears
to have been abandoned a long time ago due to some event. Several
holes have been made in the walls and the ceiling, which give amazing
views of the sea that surrounds the lighthouse. A staircase leading
to the next floor can be seen to the northeast while another leading
back to the second floor can be seen to the northwest.

Desc     This is the highest point of the lighthouse where there was once
light source that would be reflected out to warn ships. The light
source is no longer here and there is debris all over this tiny
space. The glass here is more intact than in previous parts of 
the lighthouse except with the north facing windows, which have
been blown out by something. The view of the lands is impressive
here and one can see various parts from a large forest to the
long beaches nearby.

beach to the north. The long grass that grows wildly on the dunes
is very thick here, which makes it hard to see the trail's direction.
A small private beach lies to the north at the bottom of this dune, which
shines brightly under the sun or moon with its crystal clear waters.
