sayto $n It is a wonderful thing to have a relationship with a deity!
sayto $n The gods can be very helpful to their followers and in turn
sayto $n the faithful are helpful to their god. By doing acts that
sayto $n the god deems worthy followers generate energy that the god
sayto $n uses to perform miracles or other helpful things for their
sayto $n faithful.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n Following a particular god can cause you to have enemies
sayto $n that follow your god's enemy faith. You should keep in mind
sayto $n the politics of faith by knowing who your chosen deity likes
sayto $n and dislikes.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n A deity can give their followers minor miracles through the
sayto $n act of &RSUPPLICATION&w. If the follower has gained enough
sayto $n FAVOR the deity can grant the follower what they request...
sayto $n such as healing, a divine gift, or even returning to life!
mpsleep 2
sayto $n Clerics and other divine based casters are required to be in
sayto $n good favor with their deities or their spells may fail upon
sayto $n casting. Clerics are also capable of supplicating the deity
sayto $n to send an avatar, which the deity can use to enter the
sayto $n material plane. Destruction of the avatar sends the deity
sayto $n back to their home plane.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n Following a deity is beneficial, but also hard work. You must help
sayto $n the deity by raising energy from devoted acts since that energy is
sayto $n what they use to do divine acts. A weakened deity is a target for
sayto $n an enemy deity to attack and possibly destroy.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n It is even said that deities can hear whenever someone speaks
sayto $n their true name so be careful who you speak about! I have also heard
sayto $n of mortals becoming gods or replacing gods. It is truly an 
sayto $n amazing land we live in! 
mpsleep 2
sayto $n For more information please see &RHELP DEITIES&w, &RHELP FAITH&w,
sayto $n &RHELP SUPPLICATE&w, and the helpfiles on the various gods themselves.

sayto $n to try and leave some types of gods while others may not care.

sayto $n special place in communities where you can go to get rest.
sayto $n Resting at an inn has benefits! Resting at a location like this
sayto $n quickens long rest timers on abilities so that they refresh
sayto $n much faster than if you were sleeping in a field or cave.

sayto $n Spells that need to be memorized are also done much faster
sayto $n while staying at an inn. And I am not talking about sitting
sayto $n in the lobby of an inn as you eat a cookie.. sleeping or
sayto $n resting in an actual inn's bedroom.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n You also recover your health, speed, and breath faster at an inn!
mpsleep 2
sayto $n In order to see how much an inn costs to rest you simply type
sayto $n &RRENT&w and the innkeeper will tell you the price. If you wish
sayto $n to stay after seeing the cost you must have the money in your
sayto $n inventory. Once the money is ready you type &RRENT NOW&w to be
sayto $n taken to your room so you can relax.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n You do not need the exact money.. innkeepers can make change.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n And lastly - inns are a great source of food, drink, and social
sayto $n gatherings. A particular location related to an inn is an
sayto &ROOC TAVERN&w. These taverns are places for players to go and
sayto $n relax out of character with other characters opting to go OOC
sayto $n for a bit. Being in an OOC tavern also allows you to use the
sayto $n game wide &RCHAT&w command. Only players in OOC taverns across
sayto $n the game can see what is being discussed. Please note that these
sayto $n taverns have rules &R(HELP OOCTAVERNS).&w

sayto $n Currently you are a blank slate.. but you should really
sayto $n consider adding some personal touches to how you appear
sayto $n to others. All players are required to have at least
sayto $n three sentences for a description. The game admins recognize
sayto $n that not all players will be incredible wordsmiths, but an
sayto $n effort should be made! This helps enhance the roleplaying
sayto $n of the game for everyone.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n It is also &Rrequired by level 3&w to have a description
sayto $n or else your character will be unable to level up. When
sayto $n crafting a description you should review the helpfile of the
sayto $n race you have chosen. Some races have a specific range
sayto $n of physical features that need to be considered before one
sayto $n creates their description. You should also review &RHELP DESC&w
sayto $n for information and rules on descriptions.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n To change your description you simply type &RDESC&w, which
sayto $n will put you into a writing buffer where you will craft
sayto $n your appearance for others to see!
mpsleep 2
sayto $n Remember that your description does not need to be a stagnate
sayto $n thing and you can update it whenever.. especially if you undergo
sayto $n significant game related incidents (a scar, hair cut, etc).
sayto $n Good luck on you journey and remember to have a description
sayto $n set before level 3! No one likes a blank looking person!

sayto $n Adjectives are a fun way to help your character
sayto $n stand out. They are also required and need to be
sayto $n set &Rbefore level 3&w or you will be unable to
sayto $n level up any further. Adjectives will be what you
sayto $n see before you formally &RGREET&w another player,
sayto $n which will then reveal their name to you going
sayto $n forward.
mpsleep 2
sayto $n Some players may elect to use one adjective while
sayto $n others will use the max of two. Adjectives must be
sayto $n physical in nature and not things that refer to
sayto $n emotional states, clothing, and the like. You can
sayto $n use your adjectives to describe your height, physical build,
sayto $n point out your hair, eye, or skin color. If you describe
sayto $n yourself as beautiful you should make sure you have the
sayto $n charisma to back it up!
mpsleep 2
sayto $n You simply use the &RADJECTIVE&w command to set the one
sayto $n or two words you will use. Once it is set it cannot be
sayto $n changed. If you make a mistake you will need to apply
sayto $n to the DLoC admin team to get it corrected. This can
sayto $n take time so ensure your adjectives are in the order
sayto $n you want and spelled correctly!

sayto $n Notice the adjectives are in the middle of the the first word
sayto $n and the gender and race? That is where your descriptive
sayto $n adjective will be set. When choosing an adjective consult
sayto $n a dictionary and find words that really make your character
sayto $n stand out and work with what you are trying to accomplish.

sayto $n Other examples could be &RINVESTIGATE TEMPLE&w from the room's

sayto $n it several times in order to succeed the investigation check. Those
sayto $n with higher intelligence will be best at this skill. You can learn
sayto $n &wmore at &RHELP INVESTIGATE.&w You will sometimes notice that
sayto $n when you enter a room your &RPASSIVE PERCEPTION&w reveals a clue
sayto $n automatically. You can keep using &RLOOK&w to see if it triggers a
sayto $n &wclue automatically. The main part of the clue will always be

sayto $n keyword further for more information. Now find the relic and bring

Desc     Welcome to the immortal community of Realms of Despair!
Being an immortal is not all the fun and games of being a mortal...
It involves some responsibility, common sense, and some creative role-
playing too.

                      THE COMMANDMENTS
                      ----------------

1) Absolutely NO helping mortals out to an unfair advantage!
   This includes:
     - giving, selling or auctioning equipment to mortals
     - giving gold to mortals
     - assisting mortals in killing mobiles/monsters
     - giveaway hints and clues to locations... secret doors... etc.
     - corpse retrievals are up to your own descretion... use your
       best judgement. You are allowed to cast kindred strength and
       give detect invisible to mortals when doing CR's, if required.
     - if there is no one else to help a newbie get started, or a newbie
       loses their newbie equipment for some strange reason, you ARE
       permitted to give them a little assistance (levels 1-5 only).

Desc     2) Switching into a mobile is a power given to you to make the game more
   interesting to mortals.  Care must be taken to play the role of the
   mobile... don't act silly, or say "hey! it's me Joe!"  And please
   avoid using the chat channels too much while switched.
   Be sure NOT to do anything to make the mobile harder or easier to kill
   and never reveal statistics of the mobile to any players... ie: hit
   points, gold, items carried, hitroll/damroll etc.

3) Set a good example for the mortals... You are there to keep an eye
   on things... moderate the chat channels, break up arguments, get rid
   of nuisance players... etc.  Summon or transfer any "problem" players
   to room #6 (HELL).  All conversation in that location will be LOGGED
   for review purposes... Don't warn the players about it... ;)

4) Keep an eye on other immortals.  Report any problems to a higher god,
   or to me, Thoric.  Send me email: Thoric@realms.game.org if need be.

5) We are all here to have fun.  There are certain rules to ensure that
   players don't get out of hand, and ruin the game for everyone. There
   are also rules for you to make sure that you don't ruin the game for
   everyone either. Use your own common sense. If in question, ask a
   higher level god. Immortality is a privilage, not a right.

following areas will be reviewed when considering a creator for promotion
to saint.
 
*A creator is strongly recommended to build a unique area for incorporation
into the mud. Although there is no set timeline for its completion, steady
progress on the area is expected.
*A creator is expected to demonstrate a willingness to offer constructive
input into the operarion of the mud.
*A creator is expected to demonstrate the ability to deal with problem
situations without the assisttance of higher level immortals.

the council will want to observe a potential candidtate for a period of
time prior to making a recommendation.

Desc     1) No form of harassment or spamming will be tolerated.  Spamming is
repeatedly communicating to one or more players a message in a 
short duration of time.
 
2) The only form of player killing allowed is between two players whose
names appear under the "Deadly Clans" section of the who list.  Even
in this case the parties must be withing 10 levels of each other.
 
3) Profanity and other lewd comments will not be tolerated.  Please 
remain civil when communicating with others.
 
4) Do not attack or cast spells on any of the Darkhaven storekeepers.  If
it displays its wares when you type list it is a storekeeper.
 
5) When any rank of Immortal speaks with you answer their questions quickly
and honestly.  This will help to ensure things stay fair for all players
and that any issues that arise are taken care of promptly.

make any aggressive action against a player...actually killing the target
means little.
 
7) Do not summon or lead any aggressive monsters to areas where the level
range is lower then that of the monster's level.  (See areas command
for a listing of areas and their level range)
 
8) Multiplaying is allowed to those not listed in the "Deadly Clans" 
section of the who list.  If any of your characters appears in this
section of the who list do not bring any of your other charcters online.
 
9) Finally, if you have any problems with the game or players please feel
free to contact any visible immortal logged on.  If none are present
do not take action yourself, rather post a note in the board room
(south and west of the healers) or wait for an immortal to enter the
game.

Name     The Hall of Creation --- Overview~
Sector   city~
Flags    nomob indoors noastral~
Desc     Within these halls are the standard rules and guidelines of area
building. To the aspiring creator, these rules should be followed as
much as possible.

THEME --- Before beginning your area, check to make sure no one is using
  your area theme in mind. Try to have a single idea in your area, rather
  than many smaller, conflicting ones. Since we are playing in the "Realms
  of Despair," the area should have a dark, occult feel to it. No items,
  mobs or rooms in the area should be futuristic or even close to modern
  day.
MAZES --- The creation of mazes is encouraged, for it gives the player a
  mental challenge. However, the area council will not carefully go through
  it. It is up to the creator to pass through every room and make sure it
  works properly.
AREA APPROVAL --- When your area is completed, go through it a couple times
  to make sure everything is as you want it. Upon doing so, post a note to
  the area council and they will get around to checking and authorizing it.

Name     The Hall of Creation --- Rooms~
Sector   city~
Flags    nomob indoors noastral~
Desc     Here are the general rules to be followed when making your rooms.
 
ROOM NAMES --- Standard names should have all important words capitalized
  and should end with no punctuation mark.
  Good example: Wandering the Dark Lands of Ered Mithik
  Bad example:  Wandering The Dark Lands Of Ered Mithik.
DESCRIPTIONS --- Skimpy 2-3 sentence room descriptions should be avoided
  as much as possible. The description should invoke a mental image of
  the room. Builders should try to avoid describing player actions and
  emotions in a description, as well as the presence and actions of a
  mobile in the room (use mobprograms for those).
SECTORS --- All room sectors must be filled out. Note that the inside
  sector signifies that there is a roof over the player's head, while
  the city sector means there is none. All rooms with the inside sector
  must be accompanied by the indoors flag.
FLAGS --- Room flags should be carefully thought out so you understand
  how the players will get to and fight in certain room, as well as how
  difficult it will be for them to retrieve their corpse.
EXDESCS --- Exit descriptions should be filled in, especially ones that
  lead in/out of building and other places of import. An exdesc for a DT
  is absolutely necessary.
ROOM PROGS --- Feel free to use room programs if needed. These can be used
  to confuse players or add mood. Depending on your creativity however,
  there are many things possible with room progs. (This is for level 54+)

Name     The Hall of Creation --- Mobiles (level 53+)~
Sector   city~
Flags    nomob indoors noastral~
Desc     Here are the general rules to be followed when making your mobs.
 
MOB NAMES --- The short description of a mob is up to the builder, yet
  should never have any kind of ending punctuation. Also, don't capitalize
  words like 'of' or 'the'.
NPC RACES, CLASSES AND BODYPARTS --- All new mobs should have these filled
  in. Although they do not affect anything at the moment, they will in the
  future.
HITDIE --- The hitnumdie+hitsizedie+hitplus should be used to determine
  a mob's hp.
  Example: 2d5+10 means 12-20 hp. If you want to have a mob's hp always set
  to the same thing, put the hitnumdie and hitsizedie to 1 and set the
  hitplus to the hp desired.
DAMDIE --- This is the amount of damage the mobile does with each non-
  wielding attack. It uses the same system as hitdie.
NUMATTACKS --- This is the number of attacks the mobile can have each round,
  be sure to fill it in.
LANGUAGES --- Make sure all your mobiles are speaking and can understand
  the proper languages. If you wish to ensure that all players will be able
  to understand it, have it speak common.
MOB DESCS: All mobs should have a description upon looking at them.
MOB RIS: Mobiles can have all kinds of resists, suscepts and immunities.
  However, if the mobile has an immunity to anything, it MUST have immune
  charm also.

Name     The Hall of Creation --- Mobiles and Objects (level 53+)~
Sector   city~
Flags    nomob indoors noastral~
Desc     Continuation of mobile guidelines and beginning of object rules.
 
MOBILE DIFFICULTY --- Be sure that your mobiles are not a piece of cake
  for their equipment and also for leveling. High level mobs which do
  very little or no damage will not be accepted due to the lack of
  difficulty for levelling.
MOBPROGS --- Mob programs are starting to become a standard thing on many
  mobiles. Feel free to use them in a number of ways. The mppractice and
  mpadvance commands should not be used without permission from the area
  council. (This is for level 54+)
 
OBJECT NAMES --- The short description of an object should follow the same
  rules as a room name: no ending punctuation and capitalization of
  important words only. However, the builder may leave his words without
  capital letters at his discretion.
  Good examples: 'lifebane' 'the Ring of Wizardry'
  Bad example: 'The Devilish Blade Of Lore.'
RIS AND AFFECTS --- RIS (Resistant, immune and susceptible) and spell affects
  can be placed on objects. Certain things will not be accepted however.
  Immunities and affect_santuary, _shockshield, _fireshield or _iceshield
  will not be approved. Susceptibilities are ok. Resists and other affects
  are ok also, but should be relatively rare. A list of items with affects
  or any RIS should be made and sent to the area council.

OBJECT POWER --- Use your good judgement to decide how powerful your items
  should be. Try comparing the difficulty of reaching and killing your
  mobile to the difficulty of reaching and killing other mobs with similar
  equipment which are currently in the game.
OBJECT PROGS --- Feel free to use object programs to enhance the theme of
  your objects. Obj progs that cast spells or aid the the player in any
  way should be listed for approval with the RIS and affects. (This is for
  level 54+)

the shore as it has collected here and has been warmed by the
sun. The splish-splash of your footsteps sounds like a small
snare drum being struck in the midst of an orchestra of large
kettle drums. The waves crash against a rock nearby and sends
the spray into your face and drenches your body. A large albatross
sitting opposite you opens it's mouth to caw, but decides that it's
pretty obvious what's so funny. Admonishing your wet clothes you
strip them off slowly and leave them on a rock. Without a moment
of hesitation you sit right down into the water....ker-plop.

them an uncommon respect.

clamoring from the kitchen assures you they are hard at work, preparing 
delectable entrees.  Evidently the waiter must be called out to, as the 
people here are extremely occupied.

Desc     &WBefore you is a large tome that stands well over two stories tall and
looks as old as the realms and planes themselves. The ancient looking
book has been placed on a smooth rocky platform off the side of a massive
volcano. All around the platform are floating balls of fire that illuminate
the area and the book. The book is standing straight up almost like it's
a building. The cover of the book appears to be made from a revolving mixture
of rock, bark, crystal, leather, and other organic materials. This mixture
rolls across the cover like ripples in a pond that start from the doorway
that has been created at the bottom of the book. The door to the book
has been created with actual pieces of paper with writing in golden ink that
is too hard to decipher by mortals. The surrounding landscape around the book
is a intense volcanic playground of fiery mountains, deep pools and lakes
of lava, and dark stormy clouds. Despite the surrounding area this place
does not feel the heat generated nearby.
