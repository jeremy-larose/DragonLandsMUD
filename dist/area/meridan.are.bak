ExDesc       &WHello!

&YThis location is one of many &R-{(OOC)}-&Y locations across the lands.
Each major civilization and some minor villages have such locations
where you will be able to see/use the global &RChat&Y command along with
the OOC channel &ROsay&Y. While at these locations you can enjoy 
the company of other characters taking a break from RP and 
talk OOC. 

Please remember all rules during conversation and do not use
these locations as a spot to reveal game elements. There is no time
limit here since we know some days you just want to "chat" with your
friends. Please review &RHELP OOCTAVERNS&Y for more information 
on the rules.

And when anyone last saw you.. you were "headed off to some
tavern or inn in town."
 
Thanks!
&WThe DLoC Admin Team

&wSparring pits can be found across the lands and have very
few rules. Some basic rules for them are:

&Y1.)&w Do not loot a players corpse unless it fits into roleplay
    that all parties agreed to.

&Y2.)&w Avoid usage of area based skills, abilities, or spells 
    due to spectators or those that may walk in later.

&Y3.)&w Use these areas to enhance roleplay! Please note that
    some cities, faiths, races, etc. may look down upon such
    practices while others love it.

&wRemember all general gameplay rules and enjoy!

&wSparring pits can be found across the lands and have very
few rules. Some basic rules for them are:

&Y1.)&w Do not loot a players corpse unless it fits into roleplay
    that all parties agreed to.

&Y2.)&w Avoid usage of area based skills, abilities, or spells 
    due to spectators or those that may walk in later.

&Y3.)&w Use these areas to enhance roleplay! Please note that
    some cities, faiths, races, etc. may look down upon such
    practices while others love it.


&wRemember all general gameplay rules and enjoy!
