Desc     This area like much of the surrounding forest is covered in webbing
remnants from large forest spiders that have been driven off. A strong
wind is known to blow loose webbing around until it settles somewhere
new. The inn and tavern to the south almost blends into the grey and
white webbing with its pristine looking white walls. A small hitching
post can be seen to the east where mounts can be left during one's 
stay here.

Desc     The area here has been cleared mostly of the large rocks and boulders
to create a relatively smooth hilltop. To the east of here lies a small
inn that has been established for travelers to rest during their
strenous travels through the mountains and hills nearby. The view of the
area from here is impressive as one can see very far from all directions.
The inn nearby has been crafted in stone and mortar with the stones sourced
from nearby. It isn't very large, but it looks very welcoming with its 
large stained glass windows on the first floor.
