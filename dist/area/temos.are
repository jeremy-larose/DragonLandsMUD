Each major civilization and some minor villages have such locations
where you will be able to see/use the global &RChat&Y command along with

you can enjoy the company of other characters taking a break from RP and 
talk OOC. 

Please remember all rules during conversation and do not use
these locations as a spot to reveal game elements. There is no time

Desc     This is a relatively new building and service for the village. The
interior is immaculately clean due to its newness and there is not
much in terms of decoration yet. A wall of mail boxes lines several
walls for the villagers to use.

Name     The Temos Bank~
Sector   indoors~
Desc     The building here appears to be relatively new and you do not see many
older villagers coming here. The bank is still regarded as a very new
type of service in the village and only the young to middle aged seem
to have taken interest in it. The walls are decorated with finely
woven tapestries with beading and feathers, which are quite lovely.
