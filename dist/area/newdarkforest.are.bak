Sector   forest~
Desc     &gThis is a well worn path that leads through the New Darkhaven forest
as it winds deep within the thick vegetation. Large towering trees
provide lots of shade while inside the forest. You can hear the
calls of various animals at all times of the day and night out
here. The path is narrowly defined with old wagon wheel tracks that
create deep grooves in the earth where water collects after a storm. The
ground here is very squishy indicating a source of water is nearby.
The path continues to the north and south from here. A small wooden
bridge is located to the south as it crosses a medium size river.
