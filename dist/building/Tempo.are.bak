is entitled 'Felrast,' which is the main city on this frozen continent. 
 
The next page outlines that this continent is known as Felfarthen, which
means "Frost Father" in ancient Dwarven. The continent was dedicated
to the ancient Dwarven god, Felforik, who was killed during the "Great
Splintering" along with many of the other racial based deities.
 
The pamphlet shows a map of a frozen continent consisting of mountains known
as the "Teeth of the Father." There are four ranges - North, East, South,
and west. The middle of the continent is known as the "Father's Belly,"
which consists of rolling tundra created by a massive impact many
years ago.
 
The Frozen Sea is located around Felfarthen and there are three notable
locations indicated on it. One is "Wyrmfang," a dormat volcano that
is home to the Dragonborn located to the west. To the east is the
island of Frostmeet, which is home to a city of the same name that is
home to humans and dwarves. The final spot in the Frozen Sea is the
dangerous Ice Pass that is located to the south. It connects with the
Darkhaven Sea, but has become very dangerous since the "Great Splintering."
 
The final page discusses traditions of Felrast such as a love for thick
soup, riding large snow foxes, drinking, and being incredibly loud.
